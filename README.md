Hello there! I'm XStrachey, and this is my little slice of the coding multiverse. Here, you’ll find my work across two distinct but equally meaningful domains:

Data & Research
I work with data: cleaning, modeling, and analyzing it to explore social systems and behavioral patterns. This is where I apply technical tools to investigate how people and institutions interact in the real world.
Visual Effects
I also craft motion and visual systems—animations, generative designs, and effects that bring ideas to life on screen. It’s where code becomes expressive.
These two areas rarely overlap, but together they shape how I think, build, and explore.
Feel free to explore, get inspired, or reach out if you’d like to talk about research, design, or anything in between. Let’s make something thoughtful and beautiful together.
