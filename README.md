Welcome to XStrachey's Code Canvas! ðŸŽ‰

Hello there! I'm **XStrachey**, and this is my little slice of the coding multiverse. Here, youâ€™ll find my work in two completely unrelated (but equally fascinating) realms:

1. **Data Processing**: I also dive deep into the world of dataâ€”cleaning, crunching, and transforming it into something useful and meaningful. Itâ€™s the calm, logical yin to my visual effects yang.  
2. **Visual Effects**: I love crafting eye-catching animations and stunning visuals that make screens come alive. If it glimmers, moves, or dazzles, itâ€™s probably something Iâ€™m excited about.

While these two worlds rarely overlap, theyâ€™re both close to my heart and keep me endlessly curious. Feel free to explore, get inspired, or drop me a line if youâ€™d like to chat about code, pixels, or patterns. Letâ€™s create something awesome together! ðŸš€
