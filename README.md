Hello! I’m XStrachey — a researcher and engineer working at the intersection of economics, data science, and computational modeling.

My work spans two complementary areas:

**1. Data, Modeling & Economic Research**

I use Python, R, and computational tools to study platform markets, pricing behavior, and urban systems. My projects include causal inference pipelines, structural modeling, network optimization, and agent-based simulations. Much of my work explores how technology, institutions, and incentives shape real-world economic outcomes.

**2. Visual & Generative Systems**

Outside of research, I build visual and generative systems, procedural graphics, creative coding, and small experiments in computational aesthetics. For me, this is where code becomes expressive and exploratory.

These two domains reflect how I think: analytical, systems-oriented, and visually curious.

Feel free to browse, fork, or reach out, and I am happy to discuss research, code, or creative projects.
