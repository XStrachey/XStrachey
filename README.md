# XStrachey

Hello there!

I'm XStrachey, and this is my little slice of the coding multiverse. Here, youâ€™ll find my work across two distinct but equally meaningful domains:

**1. Data & Research**

I work with data: cleaning, modeling, and analyzing it to explore social systems and behavioral patterns. This is where I apply technical tools to investigate how people and institutions interact in the real world.

**2. Visual Effects**

I also craft motion and visual systemsâ€”animations, generative designs, and effects that bring ideas to life on screen. Itâ€™s where code becomes expressive.

These two areas rarely overlap, but together they shape how I think, build, and explore.

Feel free to explore, get inspired, or reach out if youâ€™d like to talk about research, design, or anything in between. Letâ€™s make something thoughtful and beautiful together.
